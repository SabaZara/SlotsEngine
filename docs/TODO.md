# Known bugs, gaps and next steps

Ordered by what I would actually do next, not by severity alone — a few
cheap items near the top because they unblock or de-risk the rest.

Status key: **Open** · **Open (accepted)** — a known limitation we have
decided to live with for now, recorded so it is a decision rather than an
oversight.

## Fixed (recorded so the reasoning survives)

These are done. They are listed because in each case the *reason* the bug
existed matters more than the fix, and that reasoning is easy to lose.

| # | What was wrong | How it was found |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Idempotency index declared `sparse` on a **compound** key, so it indexed every round and a player's second ordinary spin collided with their first. 119 of 120 concurrent spins returned 500. | Load check, first run. No unit test could see it — the in-memory stand-in models the index we intended, not the one Mongo builds. |
| F2 | `applySchemas` could not change an existing index: Mongo returns `IndexOptionsConflict` rather than updating in place, so the F1 fix would have prevented boot on every existing database. | Found while fixing F1, before it shipped. |
| F3 | Workspace build ran alphabetically — `apps/` compiled before the `packages/` they import. 87 type errors on a clean checkout, invisible locally behind stale `dist/`. | CI, first run. |
| F4 | Test discovery glob was shell- and Node-version-dependent: 15 files under zsh, 2 under dash, and no glob form works on Node 20. It reported success while running a fraction of the suite. | CI. Took three attempts to fix; the first two were "verified" on Node 24. |
| F5 | `game-socket` had no tests at all — 405 lines on the service that decides who a player is. | The review. Now 29 tests, each verified by mutation. |

## Open

### 1. No deploy pipeline — CI verifies, nothing ships
**Severity: high (process) · Effort: medium**

`ci.yml` builds, typechecks, tests and runs three end-to-end suites, and
then stops. There is no deploy job, no environment, no rollback path. The
gate the review asked for exists; the thing it is supposed to gate does
not.

This is deliberate for now — there is nowhere to deploy to — but it means
"CI is green" currently proves less than it sounds like it does.

### 2. Branch protection is not enforced
**Severity: medium · Effort: trivial (needs a paid plan)**

GitHub requires Pro for branch protection on a private repo, so CI reports
but cannot block a merge. A `pre-push` hook covers the realistic case
locally (build, typecheck, 273 tests, ~23s), and is skippable with
`--no-verify` by design.

Options: GitHub Pro at $4/month, make the repo public, or accept it. See
the note in the README about why public is the wrong trade here.

### 3. No rate limiting anywhere
**Severity: high before any internet-facing deployment · Effort: medium**

Neither `game-socket` nor either HTTP service limits request rate. A
single client can open unlimited sockets, and the internal API — though
signed — has no throttle. The load check happily drove 25 concurrent spins
at one player, which is exactly what an abuser would do.

The money path is *correct* under that load, which is what the load check
established. It is not *protected* from it.

### 4. `game-socket` does not check the WebSocket origin
**Severity: medium · Effort: low**

`WebSocketServer` is constructed with no `verifyClient` and no origin
allowlist, so any page on any domain can open a socket and attempt a JOIN.
A launch token is still required, so this is not an authentication hole —
but it removes a cheap layer, and the HTTP services already take the
opposite position (`GAME_CORS_ORIGINS` is explicit and never `*`).

### 5. Secrets live in environment variables
**Severity: medium · Effort: medium-high**

`SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET`, `LAUNCH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `BACKOFFICE_JWT_SECRET`
are passed as plain env vars through compose. Fine for local development;
not fine for production, where they belong in a secret manager with
rotation. The startup guards already refuse weak or missing values, so the
remaining gap is storage and rotation, not validation.

Worth noting this is the same finding the review made about the reference
architecture's encryption key — a fair characterisation there, and it
applies here too.

### 6. Bonus sessions are swept, not expired by the database
**Severity: low · Effort: low**

`sweepAbandonedSessions` runs on a 5-minute interval inside `game-backend`
and closes sessions older than 15 minutes. If every instance is down, or
the interval is missed, sessions stay `active` indefinitely. A Mongo TTL
index would make expiry a property of the data rather than of a process
being alive.

The sweep is idempotent and tested, so this is robustness, not
correctness.

### 7. The load check's bonus race depends on a seeded fixture
**Severity: low · Effort: low**

Section 4 needs `pick-bonus-5x3`, which is only seeded when
`SEED_TEST_FIXTURES=true`. CI sets it. Run the load check against a stack
started without it and the section skips — honestly, with a message
naming the flag, but it skips.

Acceptable, because the alternative is seeding a game with a
deliberately-broken RTP into every environment. Worth knowing before
reading a local run as complete.

## Open (accepted)

### 8. A passing load check is evidence, not proof
**Accepted — inherent, not fixable**

The load check drives real concurrency against real Mongo and asserts
invariants that a genuine race would break. It cannot prove the absence of
a race: an interleaving that did not occur on this machine may still
exist. The script says so on success rather than implying more than it
established.

The mitigation is that each section was verified by breaking the code and
watching it fail — removing the atomic bonus claim takes accepted steps
from 2 to 10; dropping the idempotency index produced 12 rounds and 12
charges for one `clientRequestId`.

### 9. The overdraw section can skip
**Accepted — the alternatives are worse**

Draining a balance is a random walk at ~95% return. Three approaches were
tried and discarded (batch-and-hope, grind-then-race, bet-over-balance —
the last fails because bet validation precedes the funds check). The
current version bounds the drain and reports whether it ran, so a skip is
visible rather than a silent pass. Observed: ran in 5 of 6 local runs.

### 10. `reference-5x3` cannot exercise a multi-step bonus
**Accepted — solved by fixture, not by changing the reference game**

Its `wheel` module resolves at `start`. Rather than distort a game tuned
to a believable 0.95 RTP, `pick-bonus-5x3` exists purely as a test
instrument: 100% bonus trigger rate, nine tiles, one blank. It is seeded
only behind a flag and refused in production.

## Deliberately not doing

- **Load-testing beyond one player.** The interesting races are all
  per-player; cross-player contention shares no state worth racing.
- **A second RNG algorithm.** Rounds record `rngAlgorithm` so a future one
  can be added without breaking replay. Adding one now would be
  scaffolding for a need that does not exist.
